# Web-Scraping-A-Cruise-Line
Web scraping a cruise line with python and selenium. 



This code pulls data from the Norwegian Cruise Line website (ncl.com). It pulls the name of the cruise, the ship, and each sailing with its associated dates and inside, oceanview, and balcony prices. 


To use it, you'll have to do the following:


Install Python

Install Selenium (pip install selenium)

Install the web driver of your choice, e.g. Firefox (https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/installation.html#drivers)

Run the program.
